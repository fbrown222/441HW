*Week 2*
This week was not too bad for the homework. I'm excited and yet scared to learn some JavaScript! I know it will make my sites more visually appealing and more user-friendly. I hope I can understand it easily enough to make good websites that perfrorm the way I imagined them to.

I really didn't have any problems with this project as it was a light one.
The concepts of using JS in the index wasn't too complex. Really, I only learned about console.log and document.write, so it wasn't complex...THIS TIME!!!! I know soon we will start to use it more, and learn new JS "lingo." The future is scary, but good.
