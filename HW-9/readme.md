*** WEEK 9 ***


live site: https://fbrown222.github.io/441HW/HW-9/


Well, I don't know why I bother saying I had a difficult time everytime, because it should be apparent by now. I had A LOT of issues getting just ONE tutorial to work off of. For this site, I worked off of Marco Cubadda's (aka BeatenBones) work, "Simple JQuery and JSON with OpenWeatherMap API."

Here is a link to his work:

I worked on several of the tutorials given on the links from the course site; YouTube, random quote generator, Wikipedia search, OpenWeatherMap weather by geolocation, but honestly I couldn't get a single one of them to work. There may also be problems with my macbook that preveneted me from actually seeing what I accomplished. After transferring Cubadda's work into my Atom and pushing it (with no changes to his original work, other than changing http to https in the javascript file), nothing showed up on my Safari browser. I emailed Dr. Musick and he confirmed that he could see it working. So...there's something wrong on my end, which is not good for productivity, because even if I'm doing something right, on my end nothing shows up so it looks like I had done something wrong.
ANYWAYS...I got it to work and show on Chrome, thank the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

So, the bottom line is I understand how APIs work, but doing it on my own was pretty much impossible. I still have trouble understanding how to access the API's arrays, and incorporate it into my code. Hoping I understand the instructions correctly, I'm happy that we were allowed to work off of an example. I was able to understand how the information was applied (though I'm not sure where to find it myself).

I spent four days straight working on this, and I'm a little sad I didn't have a better result, but I'm happy that I was able to do something at least, and have it work.

Although it does work, I have noticed from my end that the geolocation takes a LOOOOONG time to show results. This was quite frustrating, and it definitely could not be used for a real website.
