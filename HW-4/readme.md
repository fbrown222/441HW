# HW-4 Readme for FERROL BROWN

Holy guacamole. This week was so incredibly tough for me. I physically feel exauhsted
from this week's asignment and ammount of reading material. I must have a small memory,
because I haven't been able to absorb the information this week. It's all gibberish
and I spent sooooo many hours on trying to understand it, and work the problems.
JavaScript is not my friend right now.
