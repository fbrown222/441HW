# HW-6 Readme for Ferrol Brown

live site:  https://fbrown222.github.io/441HW/HW-6

This week was a little better for me. The concept of the DOM was understandable and the examples given were easy enough to understand. Once again though, I felt like not all of the example code was shown to show exactly how its executed. It showed the different pieces, but not really all together. At least it seemed that way. Although I wanted my page to look better; its difficult knowing how far you can go with it before you run out of time, and trying to play it safe as well. I'll still do what I can before the due date, but this week and next week I'm short on time (got called in to cover for someone at work, so I'm workig more hours than usual).
