     <div class="intro">

     <p>You wake up in a house you don't recognize, laying on the floor. You look around
      a little, but you have a suden headache and so you close your eyes for a few seconds.
    When you open them again, you see a ghost hovering two feet above you, looking at you.<br>
  What do you do?</p>
  <button id="bscream">Scream and run away!</button>
    <button id="bstay">Still still and don't make a sound.</button>

      </div>




<!-- section for if you choose the scream button -->
    <div class="Scream" hidden="true">

        <p>You scream!!! As the ghost scares you, you scare the ghost by screaming! The ghost
        screams too, and throws you out a window. People walking by see you and think you're
      robbing the house, so they call the cops on you. You tell your story, but no one believes you.
    You didn't steal, so you don't go to jail, but you're officially the "town cray-cray." </p>

<!-- section for if you choose the stay button -->
       <div class="Stay" hidden="true">

           <p>You stay still and don't make a sound. The ghost slowly floats to its feet a few feet from your side. She turns around
           and presents you a platter of unicorn macaroons. At first you're skeptical, but then
         you warm up to her, and you become best friends the ghost. She then shows you a treasure
        chest underneath the wooden floor, and gives it to you. Now you're rich in wealth and friendship!</p>
