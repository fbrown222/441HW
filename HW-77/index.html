     <div class="intro">

     <p>You wake up in a house you don't recognize, laying on the floor. You look around
      a little, but you have a suden headache and so you close your eyes for a few seconds.
    When you open them again, you see a ghost hovering two feet above you, looking at you.<br>
  What do you do?</p>
  <button id="bscream">Scream and run away!</button>
    <button id="bstay">Still still and don't make a sound.</button>

      </div>





    <div class="Scream" hidden="true">

        <p>The ghost flies to the corner of the room, making a screaming face, but no sound.
      The room begins to shake. You see a door open to the outside, and a wooden cross on
    the dresser next to you.</p>
    <button id="bretry">Retry?</button>

       <div class="Stay" hidden="true">

           <p>The ghost slowly floats to its feet a few feet from your side. You slowly stand
      up and see she is standing by a dresser. She is looking at you, but then turns,
     looks and points to a picture on the dresser and dissappears.</p>
