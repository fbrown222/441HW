          <p>This is a website, yes.</p>
          <p><h2>About Moi</h2></p></br>
          <p>Ferrol likes talking in third-person about herself. She was born
          in the east coast, but spent the majority of her childhood in Texas.
        She enjoys walking while listening to podcasts about South Korea and Japan,
       and drawing people that don't look realistic at all. She is majoring in Media Arts
      and will graduate soon, if her adviser doesn't forget to tell her about another"
      class you need to fulfill your General Education requirements." If she
    could write a book, she would title it, "The Woes of a University Student Who Transferred
     Too Many Times." Apart from her fascination in Korean and Japanese culture, Ferrol
    enjoys spending way too much time on Instagram, gandering at other artists' work,
   wishing she was just as good as they were at illustrating. Instead of practicing
  illustration, she just looks at others' work, forever "studying" it, before actually
doing it.  </p>
