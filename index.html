                <h1>About Moi</h1>
                <p>Ferrol likes talking in third-person about herself. She was born
                in the east coast, but spent the majority of her childhood in Texas.
              She enjoys walking while listening to podcasts about South Korea and Japan,
             and drawing people that don't look realistic at all. She is majoring in Media Arts
            and will graduate soon, if her adviser doesn't forget to tell her about another"
            class you need to fulfill your General Education requirements." If she
          could write a book, she would title it, "The Woes of a University Student Who Transferred
           Too Many Times." Apart from her fascination in Korean and Japanese culture, Ferrol
          enjoys spending way too much time on Instagram, gandering at other artists' work,
         wishing she was just as good as they were at illustrating. Instead of practicing
        illustration, she just looks at others' work, forever "studying" it, before actually
      doing it. </p>

<p>What could possibly be more exciting than talking about potatoes? Is it "potato", or "potatoe"?
In reality people don't really care how you spell potato. Potatoe. But the correct way is dependent
on whether or not you are speaking about them in a singular fashion or a plural one. If you
are talking about one single, lovely golden potaoto, you spell it "potato", not potatoe. If
you are talking about a whole heard of studly spuds, you spell it "potatoes," not potatos.
I hope you enjoyed this information as it was exciting as it was inciteful. Have a spudtacular day!</p>
