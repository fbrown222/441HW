# HW-5 Readme for YOUR_NAME
Once again, this week was another doozy with a slam of information that my brain I think is allergic to. Fortunately, as opposed to last week, I was able to understand the concept of OOJS, but being able to actually make one like the HW wants you to is difficult for me. Perhaps if it were more String related instead of numbers, I might do better. I'll admit, I'm not great at math, which is why I don't feel confident doing the HW.

The first problem was okay, the second I couldn't do by myslef, and also the third I needed help, but I got really close by myself working from an example in the text. I think my problem solving skills need some working on.

Anyways, there was so much material to go through again. I'm the world's slowest reader, so trying to get through all the reading in a timely manner while also trying to understand what I'm reading, but trying to hurry so I can finish the reading is not a good method for me. I'm having a hard time with Eloquent. I feel like I'm trying to figure skate from just reading a book about it. I wish there was a more interactive way I could learn JavaScript...But I'm doing my best!
