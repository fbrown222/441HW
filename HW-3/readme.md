# HW-3 Readme for Ferrol Brown

Well, I won't lie. This was really tough. I don't think I would've been able to have done it by not referring to the solutions. I tried and tried to program as much as I could by myself before looking at the solutions. I was able to get pretty far with the hints they gave, but couldn't quite finish it. I got pretty confused, and I'm hoping it'll just take time to understand and get the hang of, as for any language.
