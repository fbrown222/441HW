** HW 7 **

Well, this one was another doozie. So far, all the assignments have been. So, it should
come as no surprise that I found this project to be challenging. I made the mistake
of spending too much time on developing a story, and making it too detailed. Because of this
I wasted a lot of time just trying to get the buttons to work and go the the right succeeding prompt.
I also mistook the due date to be two days later than the actual, so my work is not that great.

I've had the most trouble getting the name form to work without it blocking the entirety of the story.
So, unless I can figure it out, there may be no name form. I'm also not capable of changing background colors yet, but hopefully I can figure it out soon.


** Update**

So, after the extension of the due date (thank you!) I had more time to work out the problems. By working out the problems, I mean doing the whole program over from scratch. My previous story was too complicated for me to keep up with the buttons and coding that, simply put, I went mad. Although I would've liked for my story to be more interesting, I got overwhelmed and decided to focus more on the functions than the story.

I still want to keep what I did for the program originally, so I'll block it out, but it'll still be there. Mainly this is to show my hard work, although it is failed work. It partially worked up to a certain point, but for reasons I don't know why, it stopped working all together. So, what you will see is a more simple story, but it works.

I can't say I look favorably on coding yet.
