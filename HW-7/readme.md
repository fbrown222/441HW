Well, this one was another doozie. So far, all the assignments have been. So, it should
come as no surprise that I found this project to be challenging. I made the mistake
of spending too much time on developing a story, and making it too detailed. Because of this
I wasted a lot of time just trying to get the buttons to work and go the the right succeeding prompt.
I also mistook the due date to be two days later than the actual, so my work is not that great.

I've had the most trouble getting the name form to work without it blocking the entirety of the story.
So, unless I can figure it out, there may be no name form. I'm also not capable of changing background colors yet, but hopefully I can figure it out soon.
