Finally! The end is here!

I decided to go with the Portfolio option for my final. I have kept it very simple and clear. I don't really like to make flashy sites, because it can be quite distracting, and I just want viewers to focus on my work. I didn't really want to put any contact information on here, as this is just a project for school, but on a real site, I would. I thought of putting a picture of me, and doing an "about me" bit, but in the end, I don't necessarily mind sharing some background information about myself, but I'd rather people focus on my work and not me.

I also made the site responsive, so for the most part it should adjust to whatever size the window will be. The menu should even transition into a hamburger menu when small enough. 

Although I'm happy this class is over, I can walk away saying I was able to learn some things, mainly about JavaScript. It was not easy to learn, nor am I sure of how much I learned, but I put in a lot of effort to learn.
